# OpenUxAS build instructions; branch rivetss

# A VM should have at least 15 GiB disk and as much memory and CPU as
# you're comfortable borrowing from the host.

# First, we need to be able to clone the repo.
# Fedora
sudo dnf -y install git-core
# Ubuntu
sudo apt -y install git

# Once the repo is available, the build is the same for Linux platforms.
mkdir -p RIVETSS
cd RIVETSS
git clone https://github.com/GaloisInc/OpenUxAS
cd OpenUxAS
bash ./install_prerequisites.sh

# Once the build is done, the disaggregated HelloWorld demo may be run.
. ./path.sh
cd ./examples/01_HelloWorld
./runUxAS_HelloWorld-dual.sh
