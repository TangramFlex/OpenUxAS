Per conversation w/ Erin 20181016

- Overall objective: Automate decomposition of monolithic system like UxAS.

- Initial tasks:
  - Pick a UxAS task. (NOTE: Not infrastructure.)
    - Extract into its own project.
      - This leave UxAS less one subsystem. (Call this UxAS′.)
    - Build (and test, presumably) extracted task.
    - Build UxAS′ with separately-compiled extracted module.
  - Consider dependencies amongst tasks; extract dependent tasks as a group.
  - Later, repeat with more tasks (and UxAS″, UxAS‴, ...).
  - Document workflow; turn into a script/tool.

- Longer term:
  - Property-based reverse engineering.
    - Defined as ...?
    - Supported by tools/methods ...?
      - CBMC?
      - Assume/Guarantee?

========================================================================

LMCP only supports ASCII character set; no wide chars; no UTF-8.
LMCP does not support 128-bit scalar values.
LMCP limits number of array elements to 2^16-1.
LMCP checksum (add ignoring overflow) is weak and optional.
Seriously, why LMCP? Why not some protocol having less-obvious deficits?

Need to automate map tiling.

OpenAMASE crashes at high simulation-rate multipliers.

Integrate NASA WorldWind installation and use. [DONE]

========================================================================

- Rework one or more demos to run with disaggregated task01.
  - startup scripts
  - config files

- Are there tasks/services that require dependent instantiation?

- The 'DO NOT REMOVE - ...' lines in src/Services/00_ServiceList.h are
  self-referential; the following line was most recently added by
  src/Services/00_NewService.py or src/Tasks/00_NewTask.py. Thus *all*
  files referenced are candidates (subject to yet-undiscovered dependencies)
  for disaggregation.

- Plan a new directory layout and builder to support disaggregation of
  all targeted tasks and services. (This list is tentative, pending a
  better understanding of OpenUxAS architecture. See above.)

From meeting Jan 18th:

Create UxAS base and external service(s).
  - Each must have its own 00_ServiceList.h.
  - What *is* the common base?

Look at lmcpgen; it can regenerate an LMCP stack w/ proper dependencies - no
need to do this by hand.

There's a Python2 Amase that speaks LMCP directly.

Stretch goal for March: WaterwaySearch or DistributedCooperation in multiple
processes.

Two cycles left (Feb, Mar).

- How do I identify assets created/referenced by LmcpGen?
  - I need to be able to subset these.
  - See RunLmcpGen.sh.
  > New tools created: extract-lmcp-deps and extract-all-lmcp-deps
    - What can be inferred about tasks/services without LCMP dependency?
    - Attempt to generate build assets (directory structure, meson.build)
      for disaggregated tasks/services.
      - Try to build a "base UxAS" (*no* services) first.
  - ∃ 131 LMCP .cpp files included in the LMCP build, but not referenced
    by any header included by a Service or Task *header file* in UxAS.
    Let's leave this alone for a while, and...

- Regroup
  - Simplest service: 01_HelloWorld.{cpp|h}
    - Can we build this (rather than AssignmentCoordinatorTaskService)
      as task01?
      - Try to strip out all unneccessary code.
        - Need a minimal 00_ServiceList.h file.

- HelloWorld can now be run from the task01 executable. This is intended
  as a baseline minimal application, as HelloWorld uses a bare minimum of
  LMCP messages. This build has its own LCMP, such that we may (attempt to)
  prune LMCP to just the required messages.
  - HelloWorld seems to require only afrl::cmasi::KeyValuePair.
  - I made changes to LmcpGen to slightly improve diagnostics and to enable
    it to run without MDMS. These aren't pushed, as LmcpGen is in a separate
    repo to which I do not have committer access.

- I think the next step is to start with a copy of CMASI.xml as TASK01.xml
  (because this contains KeyValuePair) and iterate the task01 build
  (ninja -C build task01) to find and resolve link-time references to
  missing message classes.

- ^^^ Yes. Also need to copy and prune Services.

===
Feb 13th

- Finally: First successful disaggregated build of HelloWorld!

- Added tool `./show-src-files` to list source files (excluding Boost and 3rd-
  party) which have contributed code to a build executable (default:
  build/task01).

- Extended `./rebuild` to generate LMCP code prior to starting the Meson/Ninja
  build. It's better to spend an extra 30 seconds here every build than it is
  to forget that step. The LMCP code generation really ought to be done by
  `build.meson`.

===
Feb 14th

- Narrative regarding approaches, results and recommendations:

Note: This refers to the `rivetss-initial` branch of
<https://github.com/GaloisInc/OpenUxAS.git>. The `rivetss-initial` branch
is intended as the project's development branch of `rivetss` in the same way
that `develop` is the mainline's development branch of `master`.

Note: OpenUxAS's `develop` branch was last merged into the `rivetss` branch
on 20180917.

Note: The OpenUxAS repo depends upon source code from other projects.

The first task was to make OpenUxAS able to build. The included documentation
and scripts contain conflicting instructions and clearly have not been kept
current as the software and the (nominally) supported platforms evolve.
Classic bit-rot. Part of the underlying problem is the intent to support
multiple platforms coupled with a lack of either ownership or CI discipline
to ensure that builds remain viable on each platform.

I have not resolved the problem of build bit-rot in OpenUxAS. Apart from a
one-time effort (only at the start of the project) at ensuring a viable Ubuntu
build, all of my work has been performed in Fedora latest.

Much of the work to setup a build environment is codified in the script
`install_prerequisites.sh`. Again, note that *only* the Fedora section of this
script is (relatively; I haven't revisited it since the project's inception)
is up-to-date. Other Linux platforms should use the Fedora portion of the
script as a model.

Going forward, I strongly recommend splitting the tasks performed by
`install_prerequisites.sh` into platform-specific scripts in order to
clarify intent and simplify the script(s). Additionally, scripts should be
written in POSIX sh(1p); not Bash or other derivative/extended shells.
(I have not rewritten existing Bash scripts as recommended, but have created
most new scripts to use sh(1p).

I'm not sure what to do about Microsoft Visual Studio and NetBeans builds.
These will probably need to be reworked and maintained to fit the platform's
build model: neither platform is familiar to me.

Occasionally a script becomes awkward to write using the limited facilities
of sh(1p). In such cases, I have used the xs(1) shell. This is available
from <https://github.com/TieDyedDevil/XS.git>, is trivial to compile and is
(in a slightly earlier incarnation) available as part of the Fedora distro.
As I am the current maintainer of xs(1), I'm happy to provide an overview
and to field questions should anyone desire. Even if you decide to not adopt
xs(1) scripts, their intent should be clear from inspection. The xs(1) language
is completely unrelated to Bourne-alike shells; take a look at the man page
for a concise description of the language.

The next significant feature of the OpenUxAS build is its use of Meson and
Ninja to perform the build. IME, the learning curve is trivial compared to
GNU autotools or CMake. A build is described declaratively via the file (one
per project and subproject) `meson.build` using a syntax similar to Ruby and
JSON. Meson translates the `meson.build` file into a script that Ninja runs
to perform the actual build. Builder options not specified in `meson.build`
are captured by Meson as it creates the Ninja script. In practical terms, this
means that you'll have a different build directory for each combination of
builder options such as release vs. debug builds or the use of clang vs gcc.

Since my first exposure to Meson/Ninja (I did the original adaptation of
OpenUxAS to this build system) I have used these tools whenever possible.
I'm happy to be a resource to aid understanding of these tools.

Like almost everything else, Meson/Ninja is evolving and occasionally
introduces changes that deprecate or break certain constructs in the
`meson.build` file. I notice that Meson is pinned to a particular version by
the `install_prerequisites.sh` script. I believe that this was necessary in
order to support early experimentation with Rust support in Meson. I strongly
recommend trying to un-pin Meson and adapt as needed to the current release.

Which brings me to: Python. Meson is a Python program. The Python installer,
`pip` (with various alternate spellings determined by version and distro)
does not play well the distro's package manager. Let me emphasise this point:
NEVER run `pip` with root privileges; doing so will irrevocably corrupt the
Linux distro's package manager's view of its Python ecosystem. Note that it's
impossible to resolve this by only using `pip`; all Linux distros install
Python code for their own use.

The proper way to install a Python program via `pip` is to install without
root privileges into a directory named by the `$PYTHONUSERBASE` environment
variable. The OpenUxAS `path.sh` script sets the `$PYTHONUSERBASE` variable
to `./toolroot` at the root of the OpenUxAS directory tree and adds
`$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin` to `$PATH`. The `$PYTHONUSERBASE` directory is visible
and part of the OpenUxAS tree mainly to make its presence obvious. Should you
prefer, you can locate this elsewhere and rename (perhaps .<name> to hide it)
if desired. I use the project-specific hive in order to ward off potential
version clashes that might arise should the directory be shared with other
projects.

Next on the awkward-install list: Java. Literally every time I've revisited
Java as part of a project, the recommended installation technique changes.
(Evidence of this exists in `install_prerequisites.sh`, varying by platform.)
Sun Microsystems seems to care strongly about implementing bogus "protections"
apparently recommended by their legal staff; these "protections" always seem
to involve dispatching the user to a web page to affirm acceptance of terms
and conditions prior to downloading a package. This is unacceptable, if for
no other reason than it obviates the possibility of doing a build without
operator involvement. The situation seems to have improved recently; Fedora,
for example, includes official Java packages in its repo and recognizes the
package via the `alternatives` program, which must be used to activate the
installation. That's good, since you don't have to scrape URLs and capture
tokens. But Sun Microsystems has never been a paradigm of consistency; don't
be surprised if the recommended installation technique changes over time and
with platform.

Aside: Older OpenUxAS "install" scripts tell users things like "Navigate to
http://..., click on "blah", answer web prompts, etc. This is NOT an
installation script. If you absolutely can't implement an unattended
installation (modulo a `sudo` password, which can be bypassed under controlled
circumstances -- e.g. CI build -- with a proper `sudoers` entry), then *all*
manual prerequisites should be clearly described (typically in an `INSTALL`
text file) and their satisfaction confirmed at the start of the build script.

When a script requires `sudo`, it should be authorized at the beginning of the
script. This informs the user that authentication is required. Invoking `sudo`
late in a script without preauthorization runs the risk that `sudo` will time
out its authentication request due to user inattention and cause the build to
fail. Few programmers are aware of this possibility, resulting in scripts that
"silently" skip `sudo`'d programs when the user is not present.

The `install_prerequisites.sh` script shows how to preauthorize `sudo` for the
duration of the script. This technique is specific to the sh(1p) shell and may
not work in shells which follow different regimes for assigning IDs to
subordinate processes.

Use of the `sudo` timeout flag (-T ...) may not be portable across Linux
plaforms, as its value is apparently subject to (and may be limited by; note:
this is inferred, not confirmed) system security policy.

Regarding XML templates: Please learn and use `xsltproc`. XSLT is a stable
standard; XML templating engines as provided in various scripting tools are
prone to bit-rot as their APIs change.

OK, that's all I'm going to say regarding build hygiene. TL;DR: Sorry, go
back and read the above until you understand the issues.

Moving on...

Feb 15th

- In which I revisit false starts in the hope that someone may learn from my
  mistakes:

My initial impression was that I ought to be able to demonstrate
disaggregation by removing disjoint sets of services from two distinct builds
of OpenUxAS, then have those two executables run in tandem to provide the
same functionality as one executable containing the full complement of
services. This high-level statement ignores obvious details and potential
issues:

  1) How does OpenUxAS treat state, and does it do so consistently? My working
     assumption is that state is encapsulated by each service for its own use
     and is shared with other services *only* via messaging. The first clause
     seems highly likely; the second: maybe not.

  2) I initially assumed that LMCP is cleanly separable in the sense that
     it will not affect my ability to *remove* OpenUxAS functionality. This
     is not at all true; I'll discuss this later.

All of the work done during this exploratory phase is detailed in
`./experimental/NOTES`, along with many of the tools created to aid
exploration of the code base. Recommendations and critical observations
follow:

I spent a cycle trying to split OpenUxAS as described above. I learned some
new gdb tricks, and repaired some rather extensive OpenUxAS logging issues
(i.e. logging was *commented out* everywhere for severity levels of "warning"
*and lower*, and many log messages were simply wrong due to copy/paste errors.

Which brings me to the next installment of "Software Development Hygiene 101":
Either commit to proper and consistent use of whatever logging discipline is
implemented, or don't log at all. An accurate log *should* provide insight
into what's happening during a specific execution of a program; if the log is
*wrong* (as it was, and for all I know, still is in places that I didn't get
to explore), then it's worse than useless because it's misleading. Many of the
logging issues in OpenUxAS could be avoided with proper use of `__FILE__`,
`__LINE__` and `__func__`.

LMCP is an IDL, processed by `LmcpGen` to create code to marshall, transport
and unmarshal the messages used by OpenUxAS and its collaborators. The
`LmcpGen` tool is not a part of OpenUxAS; it is sourced from a different repo
and is not invoked at part of the OpenUxAS build. OpenUxAS contains *both*
the MDMs used to define its LMCP classes *and* the classes compiled from those
MDMs. The text of OpenUxAS's build instructions warns to recompile LMCP when
MDMs change.

I strongly recommend integrating LmcpGen into the OpenUxAS build. Meson
provides the means to do so via its `custom_target()` declaration.
A typical approach would be to wrap LmcpGen into a script which recompiles
LMCP only if an MDM has been touched since the last compile.

LMCP is problematic as regards disaggregation. Issues include:

  1) MDMs are defined in terms of other MDMs. This defeats the use of LTO to
     prune unused message classes.

  2) MDMs are defined with insufficient granularity. The main effect of this,
     I think, is to complicate the task of pruning MDMs to match the set
     actually required by a disaggregated task.

For now, a reliable build (defined as including up-to-date LCMP based upon
MDMs) is obtained via the `./rebuild` script.

===

- The following scripts have been useful in identifying dependencies:

  * `./show-src-files`: Given an executable (which must not be stripped of
    symbols), list the source files which contributed to the binary. The
    report excludes files found on /usr/... and containing .../3rd/... in
    the path.

  * `./grovel-task-service-includes`: List the #include files referenced
    by each task and service.

  * `./extract-lmpc-deps`: Given the defining header for a Task or Service,
    list its referenced LMCP files.

  * `./extract-all-lmcp-deps`: As above, but for all Tasks and Services.

===

- Current state:

The ./src/separate_compilation directory and a task01 target in ./meson.build
combine to build a task01 executable from which many (not all) tasks and
services have been eliminated, yielding an executable roughly one-quarter the
size of the full OpenUxAS executable.

The HelloWorld example has been retargeted to the task01 executable.

The HelloWorld directory contains suggestions regarding gdb configuration.

- Possible next steps:

  1) Attempt to eliminate additional tasks and service from the task01 build
     in order to discover a minimal "OpenUxAS base".

  2) Attempt to split the HelloWorld demo such that each of the two HelloWorld
     services runs in its own task01 image.

===
Mar 5th and 6th

Here's the workflow I'm using to remove remaining unwanted tasks and services
from the `task01` build. Note well that this all takes place within the
`src/separate_compilation` directory:

1. Find a service/task to remove.
     sh> ./show-src-files build/task01 | grep '\.cpp' | less -X
2. Remove the task/service declaration from its associated MDM file.
     sh> ag <classname> src/separate_compilation/mdms
     ... Then edit.
3. Rerun LmcpGen and rebuild OpenUxAS.
     xs> fork {cd src/separate_compilation/; ./RunLmcpGen.sh}; ninja -C build
     or
     sh> ( cd src/separate_compilation; ./RunLmcpGen.sh ); ninja -C build
4. From build errors, find task/service source files that include removed
   task/service header, find definition in MDM and remove, then rebuild.
   Repeat as needed.
     a) If at any time you reach a service/task inclusion that is *not*
        represented in an MDM, unwind (i.e. undo edits) back to step 1.
          sh> git checkout -p <file to edit>

          Alternatively, use git to checkpoint a known-good build ahead of
          step 1, then reset to that commit in order to unwind the edits.
          Or if you want to build upon uncommitted changes, use `git stash`
          to checkpoint the changes, `git stash pop` to unwind, and
          `git stash drop` plus `git commit ...` upon successful completion.

          In either case, rebuild as per step 3; we need a working build
          for the search of step 1.

5. When build is clean, repeat from top.

As the above iterates, periodically check the size of `build/task01`; it
should decrease.

===
Mar 6th

The `task01` build is close to (perhaps at) its minimum. I think I've removed
all nonessential MDM definitions. I want to drill down one more level and see
how much more of the 3rd-party libraries can be elided.

===
Mar 7th

Attempted to get dual HelloWorld programs to communicate with each other via
an LmcpObjectNetworkZeroMqZyreBridge. No success, yet. Let's modify the build
of 3rd/zyre to also generate zpinger; this may be useful for debugging.

===
Mar 8th

Built zpinger. *With the firewall disabled*, zpinger instances see each other
and the HelloWorld instances. Still, the HelloWorld's do not communicate as
expected. This may well be an issue with the OpenUxAS code base.

===
Mar 12th

Still trying to grok HelloWorld. Turned on additional chatter; confirmed that
neither of the dual instances actually attempts to send a message. Why...?

===
Mar 13th

OpenUxAS was not implemented to discover other instances of itself. Even though
it uses Zyre to implement a message bridge, the bridge is instantiated with
`inproc://` addressing; it it able to communicate only with messaging peers
that run *in the same process*. I applied the "big hammer", changing all
`inproc://` to `ipc://`. I'd expect this to have a negative impact on the
performance of the messaging system. Whether that impact is observable will
likely depend upon the behavior of OpenUxAS under various scenarios. It'd
probably be a good idea to make the scheme configurable...

I also uncommented the one call to `n_ZMQ::zyreJoin()`, which sets a group
name for the Zyre peers. It's not clear to me that this is necessary. The
original call references a class member that exists nowhere (I even searched
the git log for its removal), so this is clearly code that had been abandoned
mid-implementation.

Specifying a `MessageGroup` attribute to the HelloWorld service XML may also
have been unnecessary.

You may wonder how, if OpenUxAS was unable to communicate with services living
outside its process, does the OpenAMASE connection work? Short answer: not via
Zyre.

... Started pruning files from separate_compilation/... .
	Communications		no extra files; nothing removed
	LMCP			generated files
	Services		many removed
	Utilities		some removed

===
Mar 14th

HelloWorld-dual demo now disables then reenables firewall around demo
execution, based upon the assumption that the firewall is not configured
to pass 0MQ traffic.

Documented HelloWorld-dual demo.

Merged squashed `rivetss-initial` branch onto `rivetss`. The `rivetss-initial`
branch should be maintained if a record of individual commits is desired.

Further development should be done on a *new* branch based upon `rivetss`.

===
Mar 15th

The QUICKSTART instructions have been tested on fresh installs of Fedora 29
server and Ubuntu 18.10 server.

NOTE WELL: The dual HelloWorld demo does not always start correctly. I believe
that Zyre is not properly configured. (At the time rivetss was branched from
develop, Zyre used inproc:// messaging. I changed this to ipc:// and enabled
a Zyre configuration call which had been commented out of the OpenUxAS source.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that OpenUxAS has been
able to communicate with other instances of itself.)

The symptom of a failed start of the dual HelloWorld demo is that RECEIVED
messages do not appear in the log at regular intervals. The only way to
recover -- until such time as Zyre is properly configured -- is to stop and
restart the demo.
