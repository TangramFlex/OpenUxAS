This directory is to be used for installation of Python programs. The Python
installer, by default, expects root priviledges and works in the system
directories. We avoid this for two reasons:

1) Python install scripts are not vetted, and should not be run as root.
2) Using Python's installer for a package also managed by the distro's
   package manager causes problems.

$ env PYTHONUSERBASE=<absolute-path-to-toolroot> pip install --user <package>

NOTES:
- The Python ecosystem is wobbly. Expect failures due to upstream changes.
- It's important to set PYTHONUSERBASE to an *absolute* path.
- If your're installing a package that exists in the system hive, you'll
  need to pass the -I option to tell `pip` that you *do* want the local
  installation as well.
- Be sure to put toolroot/bin on PATH.
