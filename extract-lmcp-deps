# messages used (both published and subscribed) by a task or service,
# based upon the documentation text emitted by LmcpGen to the header
# file for the task or service.

# Extracted filenames are filtered for existence. This is necessary
# because the documentation text does not account for #ifdefs in the
# source; in particular, AFRL_INTERNAL_ENABLED.
