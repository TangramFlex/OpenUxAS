The `./runUxAS_HelloWorld-dual.sh` script runs HelloWorld in two separate
OpenUxAS instances. The instances exchange messages via a Zyre bridge.

This demo assumes the following; these may not match your platform:

  1) the presence of an active firewall which is not configured to
     pass Zyre/0MQ traffic,
  2) a systemd-based distro (see the script), and
  3) a network device named "enp0s20f0u4u1" (see `cfg_HelloWorld-?.xml`).

The script disables the firewall, runs the demo and then restarts the
firewall. Note the instructions printed when the script starts.

As of March 14th, 2019 this demo does NOT start properly every time;
sometimes the RECEIVED messages are not noted. This is most likely an
issue with the way OpenUxAS uses Zyre.
